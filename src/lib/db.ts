-It first checks if a Prisma Client already exists on the global object (to avoid creating multiple instances, which can cause problems in development).
-If it doesnâ€™t exist, it creates a new Prisma Client.
-In development mode (not production), it saves the Prisma Client to the global object so it can be reused.
-Finally, it exports this prisma instance for use in your app.
